sort symbols in asending order, merge first 2 as new symbol, push it back

law of large numbers

proce math correctness of huffman coding
general case- use induction, by contradiction

prove that for two symbols a and d with prob p(d)>=p(a)
then the resultant sqeu, the length of symbol d is no longer than of symbol a
len d <= len a

all symbols are leafs

since p(d) is greater than p(a), then d will most likely be inserted after the insertion of a.
then d will have a shorter length or equal length to a. the lowest values will be inserted first,
which will result at the bottom of the tree. while values that are inserted later, are on the top of
the
