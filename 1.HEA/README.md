# Huffman Encryption Algorithm

## Problem:
- (Logic reasoning)
In Huffman encoding algorithm (sort the symbols in order and merge the top
two symbols iteratively until only one node is left), prove that for two
symbols A and B with probabilities p(A) >= p(B), then the resultant
sequence according to Huffman encoding procedure, the length of symbol A
is no longer than that of symbol B.
